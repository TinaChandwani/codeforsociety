## Problem Statement
Code For Society is a nonprofitable organization which organizes technical workshops free of cost to those people who cannot afford to go to paid workshops

## Functionalities:
- **Search:**- The user can search for upcoming workshops on the basis of location where the workshop will be held, also by typing any keywords describing the workshop.
- **Real-time form filling:**- If the user is logged in and wants to register for a workshop then fields like name, email and the name of the workshop in the form will be prefilled.
- **Confirmation mail:**- The user will get a confirmation mail from the administrator of our website after the user registers for a workshop. Also, the user cannot register for the same workshop twice.
- **Real-time images:**- All the images on our website are coming from the backend side.

## Technology Stack:
[**Django**](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/)
is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. Itâ€™s free and open source.

[**Bootstrap**](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/)
is an open-source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS. Quickly prototype your ideas or build your entire app with our Sass variables and mixins, responsive grid system, extensive prebuilt components, and powerful plugins built on jQuery.

[**iLightBox**](http://www.ilightbox.net/)
allows you to easily create the most beautiful responsive overlay windows using the jQuery JavaScript library.
By combining support for a wide range of media with gorgeous skins and a user-friendly API, iLightBox aims to push the Lightbox concept as far as possible.
